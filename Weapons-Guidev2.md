# RED ECLIPSE WEAPONS GUIDE FOR 2.0.9
## ***Written by Iris***
### Quick summary for all weapons, ranked by how easy to how difficult they are to use:

**Rocket:** It takes a person with broken fingers to not use this weapon well. Wouldn't use its alt fire in most cases, though.

**Mine:** A weapon that you set down and forget about, it's this easy to use it. You can also throw it at people with some skill and end up murdering them in the funniest way possible.

**Flamer:** Easy to spam, alt fire is very versatile, melts crowds like butter. Only problem is if your aim is so bad that you can't even hit a single flame, but that's a rarity. Regardless, it's really strong.

**Plasma:** Easy to hit things from medium to short distances 'cuz projectiles are huge. Even misses deal graze damage, and its body damage is amazing. Alt fire takes time getting used to, but it can be used for many different things.

**Zapper:** Reliable and deletes your opposition in a timely fashion. Your aim needs to be on point, but you do not need to worry about slow projectiles. It's pretty good for killing people that run away. Alt fire also stuns people, which is crazy!

*--- Sharp increase in difficulty here (though these still aren't that hard to use) ---*

**Shotgun:** Astounding damage from up close and instakills on headshots, sometimes even well-placed bodyshots. Alt fire is not easy to use, but helps with annoying people when you have the shells to spend. May wanna brush up on ammo conservation and weapon switching skills for this big boy.

**Sword:** You can spam it, but it's not nearly as effective as the Flamer sometimes. A powerful weapon if used right, but due to its really short range, it may be hard to land a hit at all, and other short-range weapons *(Shotgun, Flamer, Corroder primary)* may screw you.

**SMG:** Extremely powerful primary, but you need to consistently score headshots (or at least bodyshots) to kill someone. Secondary requires practice to use well, but can instakill people with some luck and an understanding of its workings.

**Pistol:** Strong, with the highest DPS in the game (though this may have changed since the Shotgun's firerate change), but hard to feel out and score hits with. Alt fire is an okay last resort, but it's currently broken.

*--- Another sharp increase in difficulty after this point ---*

**Rifle:** It's a sniper rifle. Needless to say, aim well with this thing, because missing shots will land you in a grave.

**Corrosion Cannon:** Requires a surprising amount of skill to use. Primary is short-ranged and hard to aim, but devastating and can lob. Secondary also lobs, but can instakill with headshots, and lets you place minefields on demand. Hardcore.

*--- And another difficulty spike ---*

**Grenades:** Tricky to use and the throwing arc is influenced by your inertia. You need to learn how to cook them well. Primary and alt fire may not seem too different, but bouncing or sticking grenades to a surface can achieve vastly different results. Overall fantastic, in practice the hardest weapon to use in this game.

### Guide for using weapons

I have given the weapons ratings in different categories so that you can judge certain traits that a weapon has.
- *Utility ratings* determine how versatile a weapon is in regards to its predominant use strategy. This can extend to more creative ways of using the weapon, or any additional benefits it may provide. A weapon with limited utility isn't bad, it just means there are very little ways to use it differently.
- *Power ratings* determine how well this thing kills compared to other guns. While all weapons are strong in their own right in RE, some are slightly faster or more consistent at scoring kills than others (though this rating is still mainly influenced by damage). Therefore, keep in mind that a "low" power weapon does not necessarily mean the gun is not viable for use, it probably just requires a certain strategy.
- *Difficulty ratings* determine how easy it is to use the weapon. This includes techs involved with the weapon, how easy it is to hit something and anything that may contribute to it being hard to use.

Please note that these ratings do not accurately define the weapons' traits. They should mostly be understood as a quick measure of their most prominent qualities.

Also, do note that unless otherwise stated, a weapon being "strong" or "weak" against another is not a hard counter. The only real hard counter in this game is the *Energy Sword v. Flame Thrower* match up, and even that is dependent on either user's skill sometimes.<br><br><br>

#### Sidearm Pistol
    Utility:    Limited (☆☆)
    Power:      Medium (☆☆☆)
    Difficulty: Hard (☆☆☆☆)

A deceptively powerful weapon, the "Sidearm Pistol" (what a name) has the highest DPS in the game (if the Shotgun isn't outclassing it) and accurate headshots with this thing will reduce people to dust. It's a little boring, has a small clip, is not automatic and requires you to be precise. That last part is the biggest problem with it, and the main contributing factor to its difficulty rating - it's not easy to be precise, since the projectiles are hard to feel out. However, it fills mostly any role that every other weapon does, kind of like the Zapper. Definitely a viable fallback option, which is what it's intended to be.

Primary fires a VERY boring projectile that you can't really write much about. You can fire it pretty fast, I guess. And it deals crazy damage if you hit with it. That's... that's it? It just flies forward and hits things, there's really nothing that can be said here. Oh, I guess lead your shots a bit when firing at a distance. Just do not underestimate its power, it's a hidden beast hindered only by its clunkiness.

*NOTE: The secondary is completely broken at the moment and rarely, if ever, hits anyone. Use at your own risk.*
Alt fire is a pistol whip. It does not cost any ammunition, it's a short-ranged melee attack. It deals okay damage and you can thwack people over the head pretty past. Again, pretty boring, but the Pistol does its job of being a filler weapon very well.

Are there any interesting things that can be said about this gun? You kinda have to be accurate with it, which is where the main difficulty of using it comes from, but that's just restating what was said above. If you're using something like a Sword + Flamer build especially, or something short-ranged overall, having anything like this on you at all times is invaluable. You can also use it to shoot off mines that you spotted without wasting ammunition for your other weapons. In general, that's a very good use case for this gun - to not waste ammunition - though it's not like it's particularly hard to go and grab an ammo box in this game unless the map has none. Picking off people when you have no other weapon that can do this (like, say, the Zapper or SMG) is also possible with the Pistol. And, of course, when you do somehow run out of ammunition, having the Pistol means you're not entirely defenseless, though some mutators (most notably, Instagib and Kaboom) take it away from you and leave you with either the Claw or nothing at all.

**Strong against:**
None.

**Weak against:**
None.

#### Energy Sword
    Utility:    Limited (☆☆)
    Power:      Medium  (☆☆☆)
    Difficulty: Medium  (☆☆☆)

*NOTE: The Sword is easier to use in third person due to weird hitbox jankiness. This will be fixed later.*
A strong weapon, if not slightly strange to have in a cybernetic future. It's one of the lightest in the game, so it doesn't slow you down too much when held, giving it a nice parkour utility. But otherwise, it's as simple as it gets: you run up to people and cut them the fuck up. Since it doesn't require ammo, you can repeat this process until the heat death of the universe, or until you die. While easy to learn how to use, mastering it is a whole another thing, and it doesn't help that every other weapon in the game is a gun - therefore it has the "medium" difficulty rating, as you have to learn HOW to run up to people without getting killed.

Primary fire is an easily spammable horizontal slice that's not too hard to score a headshot with. If you let a toddler play Red Eclipse with the sword, they'd certainly score at least one kill by accident. Very good for hit-and-run tactics, since it requires absolutely zero commitment to any sort of timing. You'll eventually hit something.

Alt fire can be charged, and it's an overhead swing with the sword. Ridiculously powerful, can insta-kill with a headshot, but notoriously slow and has a narrow swinging arc. Hard to use, but when you time it right, it's very much worth it.

Both fire modes also cause bleeding upon hit. Keep that in mind, especially when grazing your enemies, and don't forget to use your kick (Q) frequently with the Sword. Also, don't charge at people like a moron... at least not all the time. It's a tactic that works way more than you'd expect, but for the Sword, weapon match-ups are especially important due to its extremely limited range. Be a little more creative and wary. Jump down from walls, parkour up to them and then run away,  remember that it grants you a ton of mobility that no other weapon has. It is also a weapon that, just like the Pistol, does not have a finite supply of ammunition, so you have the added bonus of not expending your resources.


**Strong against:**
- *Laser Rifle*
This should be a no-brainer, but the Laser Rifle is an unwieldy gun, and the Sword is a weapon that requires finesse. The second you run up to a player with a Laser Rifle, they're going to die. It doesn't help that certain snipers may have a severe case of tunnelvision or find it troublesome to hit a highly mobile target, which a Sword user would undoubtedly be. Of course, never underestimate a Laser Rifle user - one clean headshot and you're gone. But you're equipped very well against them.
- *Corrosion Cannon*
With some good footwork, the Corrosion Cannon's slow primary and alt-fire projectiles will have trouble hitting you. Its primary is quite scary, so keep note of that. Its secondary also makes the floor unlivable for the next minute, but again - with good footwork and by forcing the enemy to run away from you, you can prevent this. Just don't charge straight ahead like a moron and get yourself killed with a headshot.
- *Submachine Gun*
Now, the SMG isn't particularly weak against the Sword, just as it isn't weak against any other particular weapon. However, the SMG also has nothing special to offer against a Sword user but a rain of bullets. It's not going to stun you or knock you back or anything. The alt fire may instantly kill you if you approach, but that happens with every other player.

**Weak against:**
- *Flame Thrower*
This is a hard counter, both the primary and alt fire (especially the alt fire). Primary makes a Sword user's life into a nightmare, since you can't get up close without also getting into the effective range of the Flamethrower, which will kill you. Alt fire, on the other hand, will push you away, which makes your goal of bumrushing the fuck out of your enemies impossible. Use something else.
- *Super Shotgun*
As if approaching a guy with a Flamethrower isn't stupid enough, for the exact same reasons, you should be careful when you approach Shotgun users with the Sword. All they need to kill you is a single shot - you need at least several swings.
- *Electro Zapper*
Up close, the Zapper is formidable due to its stun alt fire, which snips your main strength - incredible mobility - away from you. From far away, it will probably fuck up your jumps or something, but you're still a fast target. It couldn't hurt to approach a Zapper user, anyway, but if they have good enough aim or love spamming the alt fire, you're better off changing your strategy to take account for that.
- *Plasma Inductor*
The primary is not particularly strong against Sword users, but the alt fire may be, if used correctly. A Sword user getting stunned in the air by a blue plasma ball will probably get killed quickly. The pull the ball generates may also help you get closer to the enemy, however, so the Plasma Gun is here pretty much only because of the worst-case scenario.

#### Super Shotgun
    Utility:    Limited (☆☆)
    Power:      Extreme (☆☆☆☆☆)
    Difficulty: Medium  (☆☆☆)

A neat, short-ranged weapon and a favorite of many experienced players thanks to its simplicity of use and sheer firepower. Its two biggest drawbacks - range and ammo consumption - are conveniently outweighed by the fact that it can kill players instantly with a point-blank bodyshot, something that very few weapons in this game can achieve. Excels especially against single opponents thanks to its rapid firing and wide area coverage. Requires decent aim to use correctly and weighs a bit more than you'd expect a shotgun to, but you can still parkour swiftly with this.

Primary is a spray of buckshot. Doesn't work well beyond a rather short range, but deals decent enough chip damage that it may be worth spamming it without switching to a longer-ranged weapon sometimes. Fires absurdly fast. Minces people with a single shot and has enough damage potential to clear crowds when fully loaded. Take note that it also ricochets, so you may surprise somebody with a blast to the face... including yourself.

Alt fire uses two shells to launch a big, yellow ball of death that explodes into shrapnel after either hitting a wall or traveling in the air long enough. Said shrapnel deals hefty damage on its own (provided it's not just a single piece grazing your enemy's skin), bounces off terrain and causes bleed upon hit. The only "long-ranged" fire option the Super Shotgun has, it's more of a flak cannon than anything and not worth using at short range (while it can insta-kill just like the primary, the primary only costs 1 ammo piece for immediate feedback). Highly situational, but you can catch people off-guard with it, especially pursuers, or if you feel like it, you can spam it over long distances in an attempt to hit multiple people with bleed.

You want to be close to your enemies with the Shotgun, but you have a little bit of leeway - it's slightly longer-ranged than the Flamethrower, for instance, and deals respectable damage as long as it's nothing further than a few metres away. Use kick (Q) frequently, it may help you net extra kills if your shotgun blast almost killed somebody and you need to finish them off. They'll want to run from you, so make sure you give chase and don't let go, because the second they get away from your effective range, they're the ones with an advantage. Give yourself some time to reload it fully, since it's the slowest reloading weapon in the game, chambering only two shells at a time, and you don't want to be caught with that before a battle. Memorize where the ammo pickups are, you'll need them - the Shotgun burns through ammo very fast.


**Strong against:**
- *Laser Rifle*
Come up to a sniper, blast them in the head, bam, they're gone. It's that simple. You can also harass them with the flak alt. You may not have the best range, but you have the means to approach. Unfortunately, you're slower than a Sword user, so you have to be a little more careful, but a Laser Rifle player should be running for the hills when they see you, not the other way around.
- *Energy Sword*
Just like the Flamethrower, you can make a Sword user's life a living hell simply by existing. They can't run up to you without a plan or you'll blast them to bits. Even if they do, there's a good chance you can shoot them and kill them instantly, anyway. Punish overconfident Sword users whenever you get the chance.
- *Electro Zapper*
Approaching a Zapper user is easier than an SMG user - they have a much lower damage potential and their alt-fire only really works at short range, which is where you want to have them at all times. Naturally, they will try to pick you off when you're very far away, but you will have an easier time getting to them, and a Zapper user won't have much to say when faced with a wall of buckshot to the face.

**Weak against:**
- *Flame Thrower*
A dreadful match-up for the Shotgun user, the Flamethrower makes it hard to aim while simultaneously being VERY easy to burn people with. A Flamethrower user slightly discomforted by a Shotgun player approaching can also airblast them away. Avoid attacking them with this thing at all costs. Even with the recent range buff, the Flamethrower will still wreck your shit, though you at least have the means to defend yourself.
- *Submachine Gun*
A smart SMG user will keep you at bay and riddle you with enough holes that you'll feel them for the rest of your life. An accurate SMG user will delete you from existence. You have the advantage in your effective range, which is not far off from the effective range of the SMG, so of course you must approach, but it will not be as easy as it will be for them to keep their distance.

#### Submachine Gun
    Utility:    Adaptable (☆☆☆)
    Power:      High (☆☆☆☆)
    Difficulty: Medium (☆☆☆)

Reliable, fast, damaging. The SMG is an accurate weapon, if not a little tough to score a hit with sometimes, perfect for people who like running and gunning. Its low weight makes it great for parkour maniacs and both of its fire modes bounce off level geometry. It is also surprisingly good at medium-range crowd control. Not a boring weapon at all, though it is neither particularly strong nor weak against others. You could call it a generalist weapon of sorts, very similar to the likes of the Zapper, but best suited for medium to shorter ranges and with consistency occasionally broken up by an unfortunate ricochet that ends your life. As a side note, its ammunition runs out quickly, but you will find that burning through your whole clip so fast is a small price to pay for utter annihilation.

Primary fires bullets from your 40-round clip in rapid succession. Consecutive headshots shred through enemies, which is why having good aim with the SMG is important, but not a requirement to use this weapon well. A very interesting quirk of the primary is that its shots are capable of many ricochets before they vanish. This means that firing this gun into a wall perfectly perpendicular to your aim is a bad idea that will get you killed - always angle your shots at least a little bit or change your position so you don't hit yourself. Another bonus of angling your projectiles to the side is that they increase the overall surface area those bullets take up compared to doing so perfectly straight, so you have a better chance to kill an enemy. The projectiles are very fast, though slow down after each bounce. This gun is also very good for firing from cover once you get a feel for it, and can net you surprise kills when your prey is trying to escape.

Alt fire is very finicky and funky. It fires a big bullet that costs 3 ammo, also at a pretty fast firerate, and it explodes, flinging small projectiles around it in a radius. Yeah, it's not actually an explosion, it's just a bunch of shrapnel. Incredibly hard to use against single targets, but very rewarding when learned correctly, as it can technically instakill any player with a well-aimed shot to the head. It's not easy, however, because the projectile explodes with a very strict delay. There is a sweet spot where the bullet will detonate right in an enemy's face - that's one way to earn an easy kill, but you have to maintain that sweet spot by repositioning constantly, and it's pretty tough to do in a game where everyone moves around so much. Another way is to bounce that projectile off a surface. Doing so will not only slow it down, it will also artificially shorten the sweet spot where the bullet will explode, since the projectile is not traveling in a straight line anymore. So the one case where this fire mode is easy to use is crowd control - fire away into a group of players and watch everyone in it die.

Utilize the ricochet mechanic when you see an opportunity, it's there for a reason. It helps a ton when you can't afford to peek your head out, or when somebody is running behind a corner and thinks they're safe. But other than that, there is not much else to suggest with this weapon - it's just very good at what it does, which is kill people at medium ranges.


**Strong against:**
- *Super Shotgun*
Playing the ranged game with a Shotgun user is not the easiest thing, and you will often find that the one thing the Shotgun is good at is precisely where you are outperformed - short range combat. But as the lighter weapon, you have the advantage in getaway situations, and you can just as easily mince a Shotgun player at medium range. It's a very interesting relationship between these two weapons.
- *Flame Thrower*
The worst situation for a Flamer user is not being able to get in your range. And you can make those situations happen very often by simply running away and shooting them. The keepaway game is easier than for the Shotgun, since the Flamethrower has a much shorter effective range and, unlike the Shotgun, it can't hit beyond that range at all. It further doesn't help that while Flamers excel in close-quarters combat, preferably in cramped rooms, you also have that ability with your ricocheting projectiles. Just don't be a dumbass and run into the flames.
- *Corrosion Cannon*
Primary can shoot down alt-fire projectiles with good enough aim, and the rapid firing of this weapon, combined with the ricochet effect, makes that more likely. Other than that, it interacts rather mildly with the Acid Gun. 

**Weak against:**
- *Energy Sword*
It's not that the SMG cannot do anything against the Sword - rather, its firepower doesn't, in any way, hinder their ability to get up close and stab you to death, which is primarily how using the Sword operates. You may occasionally get off a good alt fire shot under their legs and cause them to get knocked back, but that's it.
- *Laser Rifle*
Similar case with the Energy Sword, where it doesn't do anything in particular to make the opponent's life worse, but it's ever so slightly more severe with the Rifle. The SMG can hit things over longer distances, but you don't want to do that with the Laser Rifle, which excels at killing you from a distance. Being opportunistic and using your enemy's moment of distraction is probably the best way to approach snipers with the SMG.

---

#### Flame Thrower
    Utility:    Versatile (☆☆☆☆☆)
    Power:      Low (☆☆)
    Difficulty: Very easy (☆)

A great weapon to use as a beginner, the Flame Thrower excels at two things: close quarters combat, where it wins out with every other short-ranged weapon, and crowd control, where it is unparalleled by any other gun, spare for pick-ups. Its generous aiming arc is another huge plus, and it can be used for a surprising amount of things. Contrary to what it may seem like, however, its damage output is subpar compared to other weapons, especially when taking into consideration how quickly it burns through its ammunition. The Burn effect it induces somewhat makes up for it, but its another, very obvious shortcoming is that its range is very limited. Luckily, that can also be somewhat mitigated with parkour!

What the primary fire mode does for the Flamethrower should be obvious - it shoots flames. They take up a solid amount of space and fuck up people's vision since they cover up an area in front of them, which generally means they will have a hard time hitting you while getting burned. They bounce off walls a little bit, so they can hit you, too, but a Flamethrower user needs not worry about themselves that much. They also penetrate through enemies and are the main reason why this weapon is so good for crowd control. Set a bunch of motherfuckers on fire at once and then watch as they die one by one. Just be mindful that you will have to refuel very often if you spray your flames around liberally.

Alt fire for this weapon is the sole reason for its high Utility rating. It does a lot of things. It can extinguish burning players (including enemies, teammates and you). It can push back enemies, which is very funny when it throws them off maps like Dutility, but it's also a great tool if you just want somebody to fuck off. It deals damage, too, so it's not like you're hitting someone with a gust of air. You can use it if you ran out of impulse to airblast yourself upwards, it's a helpful little jump utility. But the alt fire is, most importantly, a key player in a Flamer-only tech. First, fire a bunch of flames at your enemy's general direction, then airblast them into the flames. If done correctly - which is hard to do and I do not know the specifics of, but aiming at the torso area provides the most consistent results - this will deal ridiculous damage, because the airblasted player will then get repeatedly damaged by the same flame puff. This often results in your enemy dropping from 100 to 20 HP, which is close enough to an instant kill that it usually makes people regret rushing at you.

In enclosed spaces, this thing is a beast. Running after people should be a priority for any self-respecting Flamethrower user. They will be scared and run away, though, so you gotta keep chase. It helps to know the map well to ambush people more effectively. But remember, you're just as squishy as everyone else is while holding the Flamethrower - don't get some strange ideas in your head that you can run head-first at somebody holding a Rocket Launcher. Besides the quirkiness of the alt-fire, though, this weapon is relatively simple to use, so there is no real need to explain this any further.


**Strong against:**
- *Super Shotgun*
The Shotgun may have a slight range advantage and colossal damage delivery, but its effective range practically overlaps with the Flamethrower. While they're not entirely defenseless, you will find that the curtain of fire the Flamer produces easily distracts and dispatches Shotgun users. And if you're fighting a particularly feisty Shotgun user, you can just airblast them away so they fuck off.
- *Energy Sword*
With the airblast, no Sword user has any business dealing with you. But if they do, murder them in cold (hot?) blood. That's all that needs to be said.
- *Laser Rifle*
Like the rest of the close-range weapons, the Flamethrower will absolutely decimate anybody using the Laser Rifle, provided they can get up close and personal. And close up and personal, you will be, for you are faster than the Laser Rifle by a large margin. Bonus points: burning people makes aiming not that easy.

**Weak against:**
- *Corrosion Cannon*
Usually, getting close to a Corrosion Cannon user means crossing a minefield or getting acid burns, no in-between. Getting a mine lobbed at your head is one problem. The primary of the Corrosion Cannon has a surprising range when used correctly, since it also lobs, so that's another problem, the Flamer is ever-so-slightly outranged. And even at close range, you will find a worthy opponent in an Acid Gun user who knows how to aim. Your only saving grace is that the Corrosion Cannon is hard to use.
- *Submachine Gun*
The SMG user can annoyingly stay out of your range while also being in their own effective range constantly. Engaging somebody like that is a big problem for you, since you require to get up close, and that's not so easy when they can easily get away. It doesn't help that the specialties of both these weapons include fighting in cramped rooms.
- *Plasma Inductor*
Another weapon that can stay out of your range and pepper you with bullets until you die. As an added bonus, its alt-fire can pull you in and make you helpless for a couple of seconds, or at the very least completely change your movement trajectory if you don't wanna get sucked in.

---

#### Plasma Inductor
    Utility:    Elastic (☆☆☆☆)
    Power:      Very low (☆)
    Difficulty: Easy (☆☆)

A strong, easy to use energy gun that mostly underperforms in the damage department (which does not mean it can't kill), the Plasma Inductor should be treated more as a support weapon. It probably should not be used as the main damage dealer, but it can respectably hold its own in mid-range combat, so it's a valid option regardless. With its versatile alt-fire, low ammo consumption for the primary and a slow firerate, it is tailored more towards defensive gameplay, and is always a neat option for players that have just started out with playing the game.

Primary fires a plasma ball. It travels fast, but slower than most projectiles (that being SMG, Shotgun, Laser Rifle, Zapper), so its effectiveness beyond medium range sharply drops off. The plasma ball, even if it misses, can still graze enemies and deal a little damage. Don't be afraid to target your enemies' torsos with this - headshots are nice and mostly every weapon has its damage output improved significantly with those, but this fire mode is surprisingly generous with its body shot damage, and you want to ensure you hit somebody more than anything. This also makes fighting at specifically medium range advantageous - you can keep out of your enemies' effective ranges while constantly damaging them. However, the primary kind of sucks from up close and far away, mostly because you will be outperformed in both departments, so make sure to properly distance yourself.

Alt fire is a plasma ball, too, but this one grows in size depending on how much you charge it, repeatedly deals damage to whatever unfortunate soul gets sucked in, and attracts enemies. At max charge, it uses up your whole clip. The biggest plasma balls are unfortunately prone to also sucking you in, so make sure you are already moving in the opposite direction so that does not happen. This is a fantastic zoning, trapping and, theoretically, parkour tool. Just by firing a 1/3 or 1/2-charged alt fire, you can ensure that your enemy will change their trajectory so that they avoid getting sucked in, and damned they are if they don't, they'll get sucked in. This means you can very easily get annoyances away from yourself, provided you use it right. For particularly thin walls, you can also use it as a very irritating way to deal damage through them. A good example for this is Dutility's middle room - fire it on top of the roof and there's a good chance you'll get somebody underneath stunned. The problem is that, for one, the plasma ball takes time to activate, so you can't just spawn it when your opponent is practically touching you, or it won't work. Another thing is that sometimes, if the opponent moves fast enough, the pull from the plasma ball may actually accelerate them forward, which will close the distance between you and them further. For that reason alone, it is possible to use this as a parkour tool, but this is strictly theoretical as I have not really figured out a way to do it yet. Oh, and it's worth mentioning that the alt-fire does burn through your ammunition, unlike the primary, so make sure to keep that in mind.

Positioning for the Plasma Gun is very important. You never wanna be too close or too far from your enemies so that both your primary and alt fire stay effective at all times. Since the projectile is quite wide, aiming down corridors may help you hit your enemies way better, and there's the fact that the alt fire blocks those off exceptionally well, too. You will need to hit your enemies to kill them more consistently than with other weapons, but this should not be nearly as hard. Make sure not to be a dickhead and get your allies stunned by the alt-fire, though.


**Strong against:**
- *Flame Thrower*
Since the Plasma Inductor is a good zoning tool, the Flame Thrower will find it hard to get to you, provided you play your cards right. You absolutely should not get close to the Flame Thrower - you'll be instantly outperformed and die a pathetic death. Keep shooting at them, get them stunned, and they will fall before you.
- *Energy Sword*
Sword users hate getting their momentum killed, so your alt-fire is pretty dreadful to them. There is also the problem with your primary being quite easy to hit, but they can get through that. This is not really that big of an advantage, but it still helps to know that you have good options against the Sword user.

**Weak against:**
- *Laser Rifle*
Having to stay mid-range to be a threat to the Rifle user at all is... not very good. The sniper won't find it too difficult to headshot you at that sort of distance, and you will not kill them all that fast from up close. It's just not a very good match up.
- *Electro Zapper*
Another weapon that outperforms you even at your desired range. Your best bet is probably getting up close to the Zapper and using your alt-fire before they use theirs, or just switching to another weapon. It's best to stay away from Zapper users in general for you.

---

#### Electro Zapper
    Utility:    Adaptable (☆☆☆)
    Power:      Low (☆☆)
    Difficulty: Easy (☆☆)

The Zapper, a true generalist weapon that excels in long-range fights, but whose power is respectable at medium and short ranges as well, and yet its damage output is still below average. It plays similarly to how the SMG does, but has a much heavier weight, so chasing people is not necessarily what you're going to be doing a lot of with this. Absolutely perfect for picking off weakened targets, this thing induces about the same fear as seeing a Flamethrower user charging at you. Interestingly, the Zapper can hold a fuckton of ammo clips, so while running out of it with this weapon is possible, it's not something that will happen a lot, and you can be as wasteful with ammunition as you want.

Primary fire is the only hitscan attack in the game, discounting your alt-fire (technically, it's a projectile with hitscan properties, but we won't talk about that). This already makes the primary ridiculously strong, as grazing an opponent with a few shots is trivial, and this weapon is perfectly accurate. It fires about as fast as the SMG, but deals much less damage. The thing is that the Zapper's headshot damage is subpar, but its torso and limb damage falls off only slightly from that, which makes using it at longer ranges pleasant. You do not have to score headshots to deal decent damage. It performs well at medium and short ranges, too, but naturally you cannot expect it to be better than weapons completely dedicated to their effective ranges. Aside from these nuances, there is not much to say - it really is just a hitscan projectile.

The alt-fire is more interesting - charging it fires a huge burst of hitscan rays in a wide cone in front of you, more pronounced with higher charge. If any of these rays hit, they will shock the enemy, making gaining momentum a lot harder and dealing damage over time, and they also stick to the map's geometry for a fraction of a second, so enemies may "step" into the blots left over by your rays and get stunned. It is only effective at short ranges - beyond that, the weapon completely refuses to hit. Its damage is not that great compared to something like the Shotgun (though it's possible to kill with it, and it's not a bad idea against weakened opponents), but the stun utility is very useful - it will make hitting that enemy easier, or perhaps help you get away from them. Even better, you can easily apply stun to multiple people in a crowd, provided they are clustered enough.

Thanks to the way the Zapper works, you can pretty easily play around any range you want and kill people indiscriminately, but it fulfills a very particular long-range rapid-fire weapon niche than no other weapon does in the game, and it's usually best to stick to that when possible, since you are disadvantaged when trying to run away. Sightlines are your best friend, just like with the Laser Rifle. Put the fear of God in people.


**Strong against:**
- *Plasma Inductor*
What the Plasma Gun's primary does, you do better at any range. The alt-fire, while it can catch you off-guard, is not something that you usually need to worry about, since you can stay out of range. And with that sort of range game, you can reliably secure a victory against a Plasma user.
- *Energy Sword*
With the shortest range out of all the weapons you can choose, it's incredibly easy for you to pick off the Sword user at range, and if they get up close, you can just stun them with the alt-fire and fucking kill them. You shouldn't underestimate them, however - that movement speed they got could get you killed if you're not careful.

**Weak against:**
- *Super Shotgun*
The Shotgun will split you in half. You can stay away from it and you have the upper hand when picking it off from far away, but when it gets to YOU, that's where the problems start. Unlike the SMG, you do not really have that much leeway in your escape attempts thanks to the gun's weight. Bonus points, since the Shotgun doesn't need to get that close to you to deal decent damage, and the flak alt-fire can be about as annoying as you are to everyone else.

#### Laser Rifle
    Utility:    Strict (☆)
    Power:      Extreme (☆☆☆☆☆)
    Difficulty: Very hard (☆☆☆☆☆)

A very well-balanced weapon and one of the few sniper rifles in video games that I consider to not be frustrating to play against. Using this thing takes nothing more but extreme proficiency in aiming, but again, EXTREME proficiency. Add to the fact that Red Eclipse has a parkour system and it suddenly becomes very obvious why the life of a sniper in this game is not so blissful. However, the Laser Rifle should never be underestimated - yes, it makes you move slower than a snail in a wheelchair, yes, it fires slowly, and yes, it takes forever to reload, but being able to instantly kill a player over any range with a well-placed headshot speaks for itself.

Primary is a quick shot with the sniper rifle. Useful when being approached, this won't instantly kill your enemies with a headshot. Matter of fact, you may be a little disappointed with the damage at first. But it's still a good option and you should not underestimate it. It fires faster than the alt fire and is just as accurate without letting you develop tunnel vision syndrome. It's recommended to master this for Instagib, especially.

The secondary takes a bit to scope in and charge up, but it deals decent bodyshot damage. Of course, it also kills people with headshots. It's not as simple as just playing a point-and-click adventure game in this case, since enemies have a fair amount of time to get out of your sight before you get to fire, and each missed shot means you will have to wait way longer than for the primary to fire again. However, the damage is more than worth it. There isn't that much reason to use this in Instagib, however, spare for really long distances...

The best way to play with the Laser Rifle is to stay the FUCK away from your enemies' reach. Only the Zapper can really do anything to you (which is kind of an even match for you, anyway), the rest is powerless against you until they get in your range. And if they try to get up close, just get the fuck outta there. Utilize vantage points, find good sightlines and take cover frequently, because you don't want to get shot out in the open. But even if you're caught up close, remember that you can still shoot people, and any low health MORON that dares approach you is making a huge mistake. Moving around while sniping people is an important skill to master, too. Did you know you can still use your impulse while scoped in? That's right.

**Strong against:**
- *Submachine Gun*
The SMG doesn't have that much to offer against the Laser Rifle, and playing the ranged game with it is a surefire way to get laser burns. It's as simple as that.
- *Plasma Inductor*
Its alt fire is out of your reach for the most part, and its medium-range projectiles are not very effective at long ranges, which is where you will be primarily attacking from. The Laser Rifle isn't a hard counter, but it's also very strong against that gun, still.
- *Corrosion Cannon*
What does the Laser Rifle have that the Corrosion Cannon doesn't? Range and near-instant damage potential. You can rather easily move out of the way of the slow, plodding projectiles coming your way, and snipe the Corrosion Cannon player before they murder you. But don't be absent-minded - a smart player may use your tunnelvision syndrome against you and kill you with traps you thought missed you.

**Weak against:**
- *Flame Thrower*
Run if you can, because if you can't, you'll die, and the Flamethrower players move pretty fast. All the fire will fuck up your ability to aim, too. Be happy when they aren't targetting you.
- *Super Shotgun*
Similarly to the Flamethrower, if you don't run from the Super Shotgun, you will die. As an added bonus, it has a longer range than the Flamethrower, which makes it debatably worse to play against in certain scenarios. Luckily, it's also the heaviest of the close-range murder weapons.
- *Energy Sword*
A mosquito that's all up in your face and relentlessly stabs you with its stinger - that's about how it feels like to play with the Laser Rifle against a Sword user. The lowered damage potential only slightly offsets how quickly they can really approach you. Make sure you have some good weapons to fend off Sword users... or aim really well.

#### Corrosion Cannon
    Utility:    Elastic (☆☆☆☆)
    Power:      Extreme (☆☆☆☆☆)
    Difficulty: Very hard (☆☆☆☆☆)

In the right hands, the Corrosion Cannon is a ridiculously strong weapon, held back mostly by its slow attacks, difficulty of usage due to the lobbing projectiles it fires and the collateral damage it causes to your team. With decent short- to mid-range coverage, a charitable ammo supply and firepower that can hardly be matched at such range, it promises a lot of easy kills, provided you aim well... and if you don't, you still have a fair chance. A surprisingly quirky gun - it can do a lot of things that most other weapons can't, which is both a good and a bad thing, depending on the context. Both of its fire modes allow you to deal damage over time to your enemies as well, and while the effect isn't particularly strong, every now and then, it can net you an extra kill or two, which is always something.

Primary fires a stream of green acid that can be recolored by an adept modder to look like bodily fluids. Deceptively powerful, especially when headshotting, but usually you will have a hard time doing that due to the slow projectile speed of this fire mode (though it's faster than the alt fire, still) and lobbing aiming arc. The lobbing, however, also provides you with a rather interesting advantage - aiming upwards means the acid stream will travel further, making it usable at medium ranges if you utilize some movement prediction. It's also a beast at close ranges thanks to that, but it's still very hard to use, and a weapon like the Flamer has a much easier time hitting things than this by comparison. So, yeah, beware.

Alt fire ejects a blob of acid that functions simultaneously like a low splash radius contact grenade and a mine at once. Its lobbing arc is interesting, because the projectile is offset slightly above where you're aiming. This must be memorized if you want to directly hit people with this thing at short, medium and long ranges. At short ranges, you can usually get away with aiming straight ahead of you without correcting your projectile's trajectory because of that, but at medium ranges, you do have to aim upwards, and there is really no good suggestion to have here but to feel out the arc of the grenade-mine-whatever blob with this in mind. Understanding how to use this fire mode is very rewarding, because a clean headshot will instantly kill your enemies. And it has to be clean, because the splash radius of the blob is miniature - it spews big globs of acid around it, so it doesn't exactly hit all the time, either, which is why it's more of a contact weapon. Of course, this is not to forget the primary functionality of the alt-fire: if a projectile misses, or if you deliberately shoot it on the ground, it will stay there for a while, allowing you to build up a giant mine field over time even if you're just trying your hardest to hit your opponent. This is a tremendously important thing to understand: the area denial capabilities of this thing are crazy even with severely reduced limb damage (technically every weapon has reduced limb damage, but this means stepping on mines isn't that bad), which is why it's also such a versatile weapon. Moreover, any mine laying on the ground in close proximity to a player that just stepped on another mine (or got hit by a blob in mid-air) will get attracted to said player and absolutely decimate them, and you can build up mine fields from quite a long distance. Important to note down is that blobs, just like plasma projectiles, have a "graze range" where they deal minimal damage. This is good to know because, for one, it allows you to apply the corrosion effect without the projectile being destroyed. But second of all, this "graze range" still triggers the attraction functionality of nearby mines, so even if that mine in particular is not destroyed, the rest will jump at your enemy. A really good alt fire, if not a little susceptible to getting shot down even in mid air due to the projectiles being fragile. Though I would like to point out that it's going to be changed sooner or later, because currently, the blobs that hit each other will just disappear... and a new feature is being planned to be added, which is blobs that will grow in size (and damage) upon being shot with the Corroder.

With this weapon, the first important thing to understand is that you want to reduce collateral damage caused to your teammates while using it. In FFA, you can just keep firing at everyone and somebody will eventually run into your missed projectile, but in team game modes, at least think a little where you're firing the alt fire. If you absolutely must, you can fire it in your base to try and attempt somebody stealing your flag or to protect said flag from getting captured, but friendly players or bots might later step on these and you may teamkill them, so it's a little better to use the primary in this case. Spraying mines around an enemy's base, however, is a good idea, since it's an investment for the future. Getting up close is not so bad with this gun, either. Another good thing to remember is that both the primary and alt fire are gravitized, so on low gravity maps, their effective range extends somewhat.


**Strong against:**
- *Flame Thrower*
You outrange it and pose a pretty decent threat both mid-range and at its effective range. Being able to spawn a field of mines on demand also makes it a little tough to get to you in the first place as well, provided you are resourceful when running away. The only caveat is that you have to aim well, but it's not particularly hard to do against somebody that tries to bumrush you straight ahead.

**Weak against:**
- *Submachine Gun*
They can very easily shoot your projectiles down, which is made even easier by ricochets and the alt-fire. But that's about it - using the SMG against you is neither a counterplay, nor a strategy beyond that.
- *Laser Rifle*
They will try to stay far away from you, and since you operate at mid range, you are somewhat disadvantaged by default against the Rifle. It doesn't help that your projectiles have a slow travel time and, if forced to fight at long ranges, you will slowly build up a mine field, but get an increasingly higher chance to get sniped instead, so you may not even get to use that function. Get up close and melt 'em. As a side note, it's incredibly funny to spam mines around a Laser Rifle user while they're not looking.
- *Energy Sword*
The one weapon that is remarkably decent against you at short range is the Energy Sword. Sure, you have the damage potential, but an adept Sword user can zoom around you, cut you up and leave without you leaving as much as a bruise, since your projectile speed is slow, and being light-footed helps when evading your mines. A smart opponent will respect the power of your primary, but yes, people running straight at you with the Sword is usually not what you want.

#### Frag Grenade
    Utility:    Adaptable (☆☆☆)
    Power:      Extreme (☆☆☆☆☆)
    Difficulty: Expert (☆☆☆☆☆☆)

Without a doubt, the hardest weapon to use in this game. The Frag Grenade relies a lot on your inertia for the throws, and timing this thing accurately so that it explodes in someone's face is not easy, even when there's a crowd of people in front of you. More on how to properly use it later. But even in spite of that, not only does the Frag Grenade instantly kill anything close enough to its epicenter, but anything it doesn't kill will either be bleeding or burning to death. Yep, it causes two different status effects, sometimes at once! One is caused by being caught in the grenade's blast, the other is achieved by stray shrapnel that fly off of it (Although the shrapnel are disabled for Instagib. Not that it matters, since you kill people instantly anyway.)

And speaking of fire modes, the primary throws a grenade that bounces off of terrain. This lets you hit things from behind cover, and sometimes helps when you overshoot your throw a little, since a nearby wall may help you redirect the projectile where it should be. Even not cooking that nade too much can help you score a kill if you're lucky. If you directly hit an enemy with it, it will bounce off of them and onto the ground.

The alt fire throws a sticky grenade instead. Same physics, same throw mechanics, but it makes it better in certain other scenarios. Of course, you will want to stick the grenade to your opponent, because that will cause a guaranteed kill, but if you can't, another good option is laying a temporary "trap" behind yourself on the ground or the wall while you're being chased. It can be a good surprise tool when you do not have a clear line of sight and don't want to risk a miss with a ricochet.

Both fire modes throw the exact same lightly-gravitized projectile that lobs and tends to always overshoot upwards, requiring you to deliberately aim down to be more accurate - the only difference is in their response to the environment. Of course, your movement influences the way the nade is thrown the most. If you move to the left or to the right, the nade will have its throw biased towards either direction, emulating torque (but it's not ACTUAL torque that's put on the weapon, so the bouncing isn't influenced, just keep that in mind). If you're jumping, the nade will fly higher, and if you're flying, it will be falling lower. A very important thing to understand about the grenade is that moving forward fast will actually boost your throw power a very significant amount, which makes dodging them very hard if you cook them to near-ignition and know what you're doing. Cooking nades works with either fire mode. It takes eight "pings" (about 4 seconds) emitted by the nade for it to explode, so you have a rather generous amount of time to kill somebody with it, which is both good if you want to do a precise short-range throw, and bad if you need to urgently kill the enemy. Two interesting grenade things: one, they can be shot off from the air. This makes it a bad idea to use against shotgunners or other projectile spammers sometimes. And two, if you die while holding a cooked (or not cooked) grenade, you will explode, taking everyone nearby with you. This is very useful to know, because that allows you to essentially hold hostage your enemies if they're very close.

#### Shock Mine
    Utility:    Adaptable (☆☆☆)
    Power:      High (☆☆☆☆)
    Difficulty: Very easy (☆) 

Primarily used as a trap, the Mines are a powerful area denial and trolling tool. They have the nasty side-effect of shocking people that step on them, too, so anybody that is unfortunate enough to be caught in the splash radius of one will have trouble living through any fight due to being severely crippled. What they lack by being limited-use pickups, they make up for with their versatility, which allows them to be useful even in direct confrontations. Just be absolutely, positively sure you don't kill your teammates or yourself with them.

With the primary fire mode, you throw a simple mine forward. It gravitizes as you'd expect out of a thrown projectile, but not nearly as heavily as you'd think. When it lands, it sticks to a surface and waits for any unfortunate sap to step on it. Very simple, but it allows you to utilize certain nasty strategies. One such strategy is just throwing it at people. Half the time, the mine will make contact with the person and explode immediately, most likely killing them. The other outcome is that it will stick to them if it lands with the sticking surface. This creates hilarious scenarios where you will have those fellows desperately try to run up to you before they die, because mines do expire after some time, so this is pretty much a guaranteed kill. Even if you miss your throw, the mine will still be there, so it's not like you completely fucked up. You can also shoot the mine off to put the player out of their misery. Another one is to put it in places people don't expect or hotly contested spots, like on your flag, near a control point, near your bomber ball goal (just be mindful of your teammates), or perhaps near doorways or in cramped corridors. It is a comically evil strategy that works very effectively against unattentive players, and even against wary ones sometimes. Lastly, you can put the mine on yourself with some practice and play kamikaze. Is this really a viable strategy? Probably not, but it's funny enough that you may want to try it anyway.

*NOTE: The secondary is supposed to work like this, but it's currently bugged and doesn't shoot out the intended laser. This will be eventually patched. For now, treat it as the primary with a quirk.*
As for the alt fire, it creates a laser tripmine. As in, it literally fires a laser when tripped. The said laser is incredibly devastating and, like every other projectile in the game, can headshot stupidly well. It also extends a ridiculous distance, so you can sometimes create a trap that fires a laser across half the map. Very funny. Its usage is not that different from the primary at first glance - you just stick it to surfaces and it does its thing. I wouldn't recommend sticking it to people, though, because this makes it much easier for them to aim that laser at you and kill you with it. I also wouldn't recommend hiding it on objectives, since it's very easy to see it when you do that. So how do you use the alt fire? Simple - the visual cue that an area is blocked off is a psychological advantage. This will make people feel uncomfortable when approaching objectives, so covering a place with those mines will have them slow down a little bit or take a less optimal route just to avoid the possibility of dying to the laser tripmine, and there's always the threat of making a mistake during that process and dying. Put it in doorways and watch as people fail to slide under them or jump over them. Make it guard a flag or bomberball goal and enjoy their suffering when they can't actually run in like a moron anymore.

There is not much to suggest beyond what was already said. Put the mines in smart places and don't kill your teammates with them. Have fun. That's it.

#### Rocket Launcher
    Utility:    Strict (☆)
    Power:      Devastating (☆☆☆☆☆☆)
    Difficulty: Very easy (☆)

This weapon is an instant death magic wand. Point it at a crowd of people (preferably your enemies) and watch as they disintegrate the second the rocket touches them. There are two main drawbacks to wielding this colossal monster: for one, you move at a snail's pace. You can still accelerate and parkour like normal, but you're gonna have a hard time getting around. Another problem is that just holding this monster makes you visible through walls and a loud siren blares from your entire body, so everyone knows you have it. If you're large, you gotta be in charge, so using this weapon as soon as possible is preferable, although sometimes waiting a little for enemies to crowd up can be way more rewarding.

Primary fires a big, extremely fast and hard to avoid rocket with a huge splash radius. Decimates everything it hits. Make sure to aim it at the feet of your target, rather than directly at the target, if you are on a level plane with your enemy. This will allow you to almost certainly kill them with the rocket's splash damage, rather than potentially missing a direct hit. Also, make sure not to fucking kill yourself with it. Maybe be a little careful with it when your teammates are nearby, too - though sometimes, clearing an entire crowd of enemies with one teammate in it may be a worthy, if involuntary, sacrifice.

Currently, the secondary is not very worth using, so just don't. It fires several small guided rockets in quick succession, which in theory sounds neat, but they move very slowly compared to the primary and therefore make it very hard to hit anything. They also have a lowered splash radius.

Since it's so powerful, obtaining it on any map should be a priority, though it's not like you will eat shit and lose the game if you don't grab it a few times. But you might if you outright refuse to grab it while other players consistently do. And there's no shame in taking it either, really (if you care so much about your honor, just use the alt-fire or waste it). It may sound a little funny after giving the weapon so much praise, but killing one person really doesn't change much in RE, spare for some edge cases, and going "fuck you in particular" with the Rocket is usually something you'd do to prevents others from having it. Even missing with it still gives you an advantage, because your enemies don't get to have the Rocket, either. It's most influential in situations where you try to exercise radical crowd control or when you are attempting to break a stalemate on CTF, defend your bomberball goal, anything related to objectives, but even then, it's not like it's going to make everything a cakewalk for you. With some careful positioning, you can also use it to launch yourself away from your target as an escape option, since the knockback produced by this weapon has a larger radius than the damaging zone (it's also true for the Grenade, but it's very prominent here). Counterplay mostly involves either getting the fuck outta there and hoping you won't be spotted, ambushing the player before they can react, getting up close in their face so they hesitate with shooting this thing at you, or staying in the air for as long as you can so the Rocket user won't risk losing their ammunition on a clay pigeon.

**Strong against:**
Everything.

**Weak against:**
Nothing.

### My personal favorite loadouts:

**Shotgun + SMG:** Shotgun clears everything up close, SMG is used for medium distances and for sweet crowd control with the alt-fire. Not weak against long range thanks to being relatively light, but you may wanna check yourself before you wreck yourself on a Zapper or Sniper user or something. Just because you can move so fast doesn't mean you'll be fine.

**SMG + Zapper:** SMG covers close and medium range and also crowd control, Zapper covers long range and infuriates enemies with alt fire stun. Both weapons are pretty good when used interchangably, too, so if you run out of ammo in one clip, you can switch to another and you'll be fine. A pretty terrifying loadout in its own right - SMG DPS is insane with good aim, and Zapper projects enough force over a distance to murder anything you can look at.

**Plasma + Corroder:** More of a support loadout, but it will net you a shitload of points in team modes, probably. Plasma is your medium-range tool for harassment and defense. Corroder is your main damage dealer. Corroder primary makes short work of people at close range, provided you can aim. Secondary makes your enemies' lives a living hell. Do note that this loadout is incredibly good at also fucking your own team over, so be careful.
