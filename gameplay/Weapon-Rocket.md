### Description

This weapon is an instant death magic wand. Point it at a crowd of people (preferably your enemies) and watch as they disintegrate the second the rocket touches them. There are two main drawbacks to wielding this colossal monster: for one, you move at a snail's pace. You can still accelerate and parkour like normal, but you're gonna have a hard time getting around. Another problem is that just holding this monster makes you visible through walls and a loud siren blares from your entire body, so everyone knows you have it. If you're large, you gotta be in charge, so using this weapon as soon as possible is preferable, although sometimes waiting a little for enemies to crowd up can be way more rewarding.

### Primary

Primary fires a big, extremely fast and hard to avoid rocket with a huge splash radius. Decimates everything it hits. Make sure to aim it at the feet of your target, rather than directly at the target, if you are on a level plane with your enemy. This will allow you to almost certainly kill them with the rocket's splash damage, rather than potentially missing a direct hit. Also, make sure not to fucking kill yourself with it. Maybe be a little careful with it when your teammates are nearby, too - though sometimes, clearing an entire crowd of enemies with one teammate in it may be a worthy, if involuntary, sacrifice.

### Secondary

Currently, the secondary is not very worth using, so just don't. It fires several small guided rockets in quick succession, which in theory sounds neat, but they move very slowly compared to the primary and therefore make it very hard to hit anything. They also have a lowered splash radius.

### Tips

Since it's so powerful, obtaining it on any map should be a priority, though it's not like you will eat shit and lose the game if you don't grab it a few times. But you might if you outright refuse to grab it while other players consistently do. And there's no shame in taking it either, really (if you care so much about your honor, just use the alt-fire or waste it). It may sound a little funny after giving the weapon so much praise, but killing one person really doesn't change much in RE, spare for some edge cases, and going "fuck you in particular" with the Rocket is usually something you'd do to prevents others from having it. Even missing with it still gives you an advantage, because your enemies don't get to have the Rocket, either. It's most influential in situations where you try to exercise radical crowd control or when you are attempting to break a stalemate on CTF, defend your bomberball goal, anything related to objectives, but even then, it's not like it's going to make everything a cakewalk for you. With some careful positioning, you can also use it to launch yourself away from your target as an escape option, since the knockback produced by this weapon has a larger radius than the damaging zone (it's also true for the Grenade, but it's very prominent here). Counterplay mostly involves either getting the fuck outta there and hoping you won't be spotted, ambushing the player before they can react, getting up close in their face so they hesitate with shooting this thing at you, or staying in the air for as long as you can so the Rocket user won't risk losing their ammunition on a clay pigeon.
